    <h1>A Simple Example</h1>
    <p>Let's imagine the payer needs a transcript written for an audio recording. He is willing to pay 0.5 ETH for the service, and sets a <i>service deposit</i> of 0.1 ETH. He also sets an <i>autorelease timer</i>, which is explained later.</p>

    <p>For more guidance on what values to choose, see <a href="/creatingbops.html">Creating Effective WPs</a>. This page is more of an overview of the entire life cycle of a WP.</p>
    <p>After clicking "Create WP," it will be created within the next few Ethereum blocks and will be publicly viewable via the interact page:</p>

    <p>The above image shows the payer's view of the WP. Other users don't see the "recover" button or the payer statement input form at the bottom.</p>
    <p>Until and unless a worker is found, the WP is in the "Open" state. In this state, the payer can cancel the payment and recover the entire payment. He can also add more funds or log additional Payer Statements if he likes.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, other users are browsing through Open WPs looking for jobs they can do with service deposits they can afford.</p>

    <p>If one of these users is confident they can do the work, they can pay the service deposit to become the WP's worker. The WP will now show a "Committed" state with the worker locked in. Additionally, the worker will see a "Worker Statement" form to begin communicating with the payer.</p>

    <p>The WP is now in the "Committed" state. In this state, the worker is locked into the contract, and the payer can no longer recover the payment. Note that the committed WP is holding not only the payer's original payment, but also the worker's service deposit (in this example, 0.6 ETH in total).</p>
    <p>The fate of this 0.6 ETH is decided by the payer. Although he cannot directly recover it, he can still choose whether to release the payment to the worker or burn it (as in <a href="/example.html" style="cursor:pointer" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-html="true" data-trigger="focus" data-content="When ether is &lt;i&gt;burned&lt;/i&gt;, this means it&#39;s sent to the address 0x0. Since no one can access any funds from this address, the ether is effectively destroyed&mdash;removed permanently from circulation." data-original-title="" title="">destroy</a>). He can burn or release in parts or all at once.</p>
    <p>As you can see, the auto-release timer has already started counting down. This is really just protection from a "lazy payer." The payer can reset this as many times as he wants, up to the amount he specified upon WP creation (5 days, in our example). If the timer reaches 0, the worker will see a "Trigger Auto-release" button. This will release all remaining ether to the worker.</p>

    <p>While in the Committed state, the worker and payer begin communication using the Worker and Payer Statements respectively. Because these statements are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, they are reliable, signed, permanent and unhackable. They are also a little expensive and public, so payers and workers may negotiate a private place to chat instead. In either case, the event log below the WP information will show their public actions:</p><p>

    <p>If the worker provides the transcription, the payer can release the payment. If not, the payer can burn it. Once the entire payment has been either burned or released, the WP moves to its final state, "Closed."</p>

    <hr>
    <p>WPs utilize game theory to strongly guarantee the following, assuming <a href="/creatingbops.html">an appropriate service deposit is set</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payers unwilling to pay for the job will never open a WP in the first place; therefore, each Open WP represents a legitimate opportunity for some capable worker to earn the payment.</li>
      <li>A payer will only release the payment if the worker completes the job, otherwise the payer will burn it.</li>
      <li>Only capable, confident workers will risk investing the service deposit to commit to a WP. The higher the service deposit, the more confident the worker must be.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're interested in the details, see our <a href="/gametheory.html">more rigorous exploration of the game theory involved</a>.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, feel free to check out the <a href="/browse.html">list of WPs</a> or <a href="/create.html">open up your own WP</a>!</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Finally, let me point out that because WPs are nothing more than a specific kind of smart contract, anyone else can create other kinds of interfaces or tools for WPs. As long as these other tools follow the same <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x38b394cd27c3b0d865f58a4512b65c7b0ab6db66">WP Factory contract</a>, the pool of WPs will be shared as well: a WP created by any one interface would be reflected on all of them.</p>
    <p>For example, one could create:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A server that monitors WPs and emails users when a WP's state changes (the server could charge X ETH per Y notifications)</li>
      <li>A more advanced search/browse utility, to filter through the total pool of WPs</li>
      <li>A bot that responds to WPs of a given format, to provide some automatic service</li>
      <li>A specialized interface that creates WPs for some specific use-case</li>
      <li>A tool that analyzes and aggregates data for specific Ethereum addresses, facilitating reputation research: how much has a given user released vs burned? How many WPs have they used?</li>
    </ul>
